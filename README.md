Open-Page-in-Default-Browser
============================

A small Java program that enables you to open a window on your default browser. Now by itself, this program may not be as useful as you would have imagined, because its probably faster just to open a browser from your desktop. However, this is a nifty program that can be used for larger projects, if developed further. If anyone comes up with better code or new additions to the code, please feel free to message me.
